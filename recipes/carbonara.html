        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This traditional carbonara recipe was created in the Lazio
            region (the area around Rome) in the middle of the 20th
            century, after World War II. We don't use cream, milk,
            garlic, onions, or other extra ingredients; we use only
            guanciale, eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, and lots of black
                pepper (carbonaro is Italian for coal miner).</p>
